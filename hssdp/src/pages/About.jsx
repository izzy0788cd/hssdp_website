                        The Health Services Sector Development Project (HSSDP) is a National Department of Health initiative, co-financed by loans from the Asian Development Bank and grants from the Australian Government. It supports the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and aims to progress toward universal health coverage (UHC) in Papua New Guinea.
                        <br /><br />
                        The project builds on the success of the Rural Primary Health Services Delivery Project and focuses on strengthening the health system through improvements in planning, governance, leadership, financial management, and community health awareness. It also aims to improve information systems, pharmaceutical availability, and medical supply chains.
